# task-tracker-roadmap-sh

### A little about what it is:
- Task Tracker is a cli-based task maintaining app. However, this is on a beginner level only.
- In the name of db, we have a json file which acts as a database where we only read from or dump entire list of tasks, once a command gets executed.
- This is written in java.
